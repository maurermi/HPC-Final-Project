This is a serial implementation of a Hashcash hash finder. 
This implementation tries values one by one until a valid hash is found.
Compilation can be done using the provided makefile, and 
sample test scripts can be found in DiffTestScripts

Note: The test scripts in DiffTestScripts need 
a second input value to initalize the counter 

To run, use the following line:
./hashing <difficulty = 6> <start point = 1>
